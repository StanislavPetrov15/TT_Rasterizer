GENERAL NOTES

  - the library does not depend on third-party code; it depends only on few functions in the C++ standard library

  - software rasterizer (it does not use hardware acceleration)

  - it implements gray-scale anti-aliasing

  - the characters/string are 'drawn' in a byte array which then has to be visualized using (low-level graphic API's
    such as GDI, GDI+, Direct2D, etc) or (high-level graphic libraries such as Cairo, SDL, etc)

  - the bitmap in which the characters/strings are drawn can be:
    - RGBA (32bpp)
    - BGRA (32bpp)

  - it uses bottom-up coordinate system, i.e. Y coordinate 0 is the bottom row of the canvas

  - the position of the characters/strings is specified by using real numbers

  - the size of the characters is specified in pixels - the size specifies the line height

  - for now it does not support:
    - font collection files
    - right-to-left languages scripts (i.e. Hebrew, Arabic, Syriac, Persian, Uighur, Urdu, etc)
    - vertical languages/scripts
    - color emojis
    - character/string rotation
    - hinting (highly unlikely that it will be implemented in future versions)
    - variable fonts (highly unlikely that it will be implemented in future versions)

  - the library is not intended for visualizing characters with size (i.e. line height) lower than 12px (atleast for now)

  - the library does not validate the font files - it should be used only on trusted font files

  - the library is tested on Windows 11 only, but since it does not have any dependencies it should produce the same results
     on any other system that can produce C++14 code (with some small changes related to the C++ standard library)

  - a character or string is positioned at the baseline; for example if a character/string has Y set to 109, then the baseline of
    the character/string has vertical position 109 (row with index 109) in the canvas

  - problems:
    - (MAJOR) performance-wise it's quite slow - it can draw (about ~1500 'R' characters with size ~30px) per second on Ð° low-end machine,
          which is atleast few times slower than stb_truetype for example; performance will be addressed in the near future;
          next version will have support for threads and pre-computed characters/strings so it should be considerably faster
    - (MAJOR) only single-color strings; next version will have support for gradient-colored strings
    - (MAJOR) cannot properly visualize characters with self-intersecting contours (for example Unicode codepoint Dx181 in Castellar (typeface) or
      Unicode codepoint Dx198 in Viner Hand (typeface)); most likely this will be addressed in the next version
    - (MINOR) the library can potentially use a lot of memory if the visualized character is very large:
      - for example it uses (~4MB if the character is 1000x1000px) or (~16MB if the character is 2000x2000px)
        (*) for most real-world characters it will be no more than 1MB, as they will be much smaller
      - also the library makes a copy of the currently used font in the memory; very few fonts are very big though (over 10 MB)

USAGE EXAMPLE 

    it's not a complete working example; you must visualize the canvas on the screen with additional code 

        #include <Windows.h> 
        #include <functional>
        #include <string>
        #include "TT_Parser.cpp"
        #include "TT_Rasterizer.cpp"
    
        FILE* file = nullptr;
      
        std::wstring filepath = L"<font.ttf>"; //replace with real font path
       
        _wfopen_s(&file, filepath.c_str(), L"rb");
    
        int canvasWidth = <N>;
        int canvasWidth = <N>;
        
        TT_Parser::Font* font = TT_Parser::ParseFont(file);
    
        unsigned char TT_Canvas = new unsigned char[canvasWidth * canvasHeight * 4];
    
        for (int i = 0; i < canvasWidth * canvasHeight * 4; i++)
        {
            TT_Canvas[i] = 255;
        }
    
        TT_Rasterizer::DrawString(
           L"Example string",
           font,
           TT_Canvas,
           TT_Rasterizer::ColorComponentOrder::BGRA,
           canvasWidth,
           canvasHeight,
           20, //x (in pixels)
           20, //y (in pixels)
           100, //size (in pixels)

           and (the right-side bearing of the last character)
   - (graphemic pixels) :: the pixels of (a contour or a glyph) that are either contour or interior pixels
   - (graphemic width) ::
       (1) when applied to a single character, it means the width of the character without (the left-side bearing) and (the right-side bearing),
           i.e. the distance between the left-most and right-most graphemic points of the character
       (2) when applied to a character string, it means the width of the string without (the left-side bearing of the first character)
           and (the right-side bearing of the last character), i.e. the distance between the left-most and right-most graphemic points of the string
   - (graphemic height) ::
       (1) when applied to a single character, it means the distance between the highest and lowest point of the character
       (2) when applied to a character string, it means the distance between the highest and lowest graphemic points of the string
   - (graphema) all the graphemic pixels for (a contour or a glyph), i.e. the visual representation of (a contour or a glyph) on the screen
